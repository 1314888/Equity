	- How is other competing asset classes doing
	
## Price and Volume Trend
What trend is the stock showing?

	- What is the price trend, growth in 1 week / 1 month 
		- Not good when the stock makes too much money in too little time
	- What is the volume trend
	- How is the volatility like - focus on stocks with linearity, does not swings all over the place

		- Insider buying price
	- Key growth and drops in the past

Reaction to events

	- How did it react to bad news (bad earnings last time)
	- How did it hold up during market correction, how much bad news for it to fall

Relative strength

	- Is it the first to rebound after market come off from relative low
	- Did it fall more than peers during fall, rise more than peers during bull?
	- Who is the leader, laggard here?
	
For earnings surprise, or news

	- Difference in actual vs expected (earnings or news etc) 
	- If it has already been trending up when the market is flat, that means it has probably been discounted
	- If it has been trending downwards, then earning is good, shorts have to cover, new investor wants to buy. 
	- Event is undiscounted, price can go up

## Competitive Advantage
How did the industry as a whole perform, is it expecting to grow?  
How is business in different sub sectors (geography, demographic etc)  
What is its main source of revenue?

	- Do not want to be dependent on a single customer for income (if they are middle of supply chain) 

What is its main products and services?

	- Do not want diworisifcation when they diverse business to other stuff that is outside core experise

What is its competitive advantage?

	- Do not want a company that is doing great but have a competitor is creeping up to it and no one notice

Who is its main competitor?  
What is their growth plan

	- Is their growth plan flawed or sound

Is there analyst coverage? 

	- The more then the worse (more efficient) 

## Shareholder Structure And Management
Is there insider ownership?

	- Possible find out what price they buy at, try to buy lower than them
	- Compare the amount of stock a person buys with his Net Worth and salary
	- Make sure that it is purchase of new shares and not exercise of options
	- Lots of insider ownserhip is good (job security vs stock appreciation) 

Is there institutional ownership?  
Is there share buyback?  
Who is their largest shareholder?  
Is the management team stable, are there a lot of changes(high turnovers in CFO)  
Does the management blame performance on other factors like short sellers etc  
Has there been a change in auditor? Why?  

## Financials
### Valuation
What is the PE compared to industry and peers?

	- If P/E between 8 - 12 times (any significant change can affect stock price)
	- Do not want P/E that is too high
	- Do not want low absolute earnings too
	- P/E vs growth rate + dividend yield

Can try to get earnings of individual sub business and assign hypothetical PE to get their valuation

### Revenue
What is the revenue like?

	- What product contribute to what percent of sales?
	- Maybe revenue is declining but it keep earnings up by cutting cost

### Earnings
When next earnings date will be released  
How far does year to date earnings differ from past year  
How is the Q - Q earnings?  
What is the return on equity?  
What is the earnings trend?

	- Has there been a down quarter?
	- Year to year how is the earnings, strong earnings record every quarter?
	- How did earnings perform during recession
	- What is the growth rate in earnings

How does earnings compare to competitors and industry

### Profit Margin
How is the profit margin like?

	- High profit margin is good for long term value and holding
	- High profit margin might be bad because it means that there is no room for improvement
	- For turn around you want it to be low because for the same increase in sales and costs, the EBIT will increase more

### Dividend Yield
History of dividend, does it pay during bad times, over a long period

	- Does it reduce div, increase etc
	- Dividend yield change with stock price ($2 dividend is 20% for $10, and 10% for $20)

Do not want that in a high growth company

### Cash
Free Cash flow per stock (OCF - CAPEX)

	- EBIT (1-tax rate) + (depreciation) + (amortization) - (change in net working capital) - (capital expenditure)
		- Working Capital = CA - CL 
Is a lot of capex required to keep the business running?

### Debt
Debt equity <30%  
Type of debt (funded debt vs due on demand)  
Cash - long term debt / share about more than 30%  
Is interest coverage ok?  

### Book 
Cannot be priced properly, the closer to finish product the less value

	- What is the actual number in a bankruptcy sale?
Does it have legacy assets that are undervalued?  
Does it have goodwill (extra over book value) that is slowly written off?  
Did any asset get write off unfairly?  
Parent vs subsidiary unfair pricing? Who is cheaper  
Tax loss carry forward, operating loss carry forward  
	

### Inventory 
Inventory piling up is bad 

	- If revenue increase while inventory pile up might be marked down
	- Inventory that have value like cars pile up is better than clothes that have little value 

### Others
Make sure pension fund asset > vested benefit liability  
Do not want recievables to pile up
