Who is its main competitor?  
What is their growth plan
- Is their growth plan flawed or sound

Is there analyst coverage? 
- The more then the worse (more efficient) 

What type of company is this?
	1. Fast Growth
	2. Big Utility
	3. Turnaround
	4. Dividend
	5. Cyclical 
	6. Hidden Assets

- Possible find out what price they buy at, try to buy lower than them
- Compare the amount of stock a person buys with his Net Worth and salary
- Make sure that it is purchase of new shares and not exercise of options

# 4 Financials
## 4.1 Income statement
#### Revenue
- What product contribute to what percent of sales?
- Gross Profit Margin at least 30, 40% and above is good

#### Operating Expenses
- SGA (salary, advert, travel, legal, comm)
	- Consistency the most important, keep it between 30 - 80%
- Low R&D cost <30%
- Depreciation cost <20% (not capital intensive)

#### Interest 
- Low interest payment <30% of EBIT

#### Earnings
When next earnings date will be released?   
Remember to remove non-recurring / one off events from earnings    
Not that revenue is declining but it might keep up earnings up by cutting cost  
Note that EPS might be affected by
- Share repurcahsing, hence if looking at trend, look at total earnings  

Earnings Trend
- How far does year to date earnings differ from past year  
- How is the Q - Q earnings? 
- What is the quarterly and yearly earnings trend?
	- Got down before? Why?
- How did earnings perform during recession

Profit Margin
- Net profit margin >20%, at least 10%
- High profit margin is good for long term value and holding
- High profit margin might be bad because it means that there is no room for improvement
	- For example, for turnaround you want it to be low because for the same increase in sales and costs, the EBIT will increase more
ROE >20% 
ROA >10 %
What is the growth rate in earnings  
How does earnings compare to competitors and industry

#### 4.2 Balance Sheet 

#### Cash, Inventory, Recievables
A lot of cash is good but make sure it is not created by one off event
- Lots of cash and no debt for turnaround is good
- Can subtract against the price of share when valuating
- Cash - long term debt / share about more than 30%  

Inventory piling up is bad 
- If revenue increase while inventory pile up, it might be marked down for sale, but might be ok still
	- Inventory that have value like cars pile up is better than clothes that have little value 
- Consistent inventory most important

Lower net recievables / sales imply a good competitive advantage
	- Do not want recievables to pile up  
#### PPE 
Look at the ratio of PPE to debt
-  Should be able to finance it internally

Is a lot of capex required to keep the business running?  
Look at capex 10 years vs earnings 10 years 50% less is good, 25% is better    
*Look at 2 peroid PPE, add back deprecation to get capex or look under CFI*

#### Debt
Short term debt is supsectaible to sudden shift in credit markets
- Compare short term to long term debt ratio, don’t let it be more 
	
Long term Debt - Good companies are supposed to be self financing
- Net earnings must be able to pay of long term debt in 3 - 4 years
	- Can compare FCF - long term debt also
		- Free Cash flow (CFO - CAPEX)
- Debt equity <30%, max 80%
 	- Can be overstated if company is buying back shares and decreases shareholder equity
	- Hence if that is the case, must add back treasruy stock
- Look at the trend over last 10 years, if little then good
- If have significant debt then
	- Is it due a a leverage buyout or what?
	- Analyze the debt structure
		- What is the type of debt (funded debt vs due on demand) 
		- When is the debt due
#### Others
Total Book Value 
- Sometimes hard to be priced properly
	- The closer to finish product the less value
	- What is the actual number in a bankruptcy sale?	

Find hidden gems in	
- Does it have legacy assets that are undervalued?  
- Does it have goodwill (extra over book value) that is slowly written off?  
- Did any asset get write off unfairly?  
- Parent vs subsidiary unfair pricing? Who is cheaper  
- Tax loss carry forward, operating loss carry forward

Pension
- Make sure pension fund asset > vested benefit liability  

Long term investment
- Could also reflect investement mindset of top management

#### 4.3 Statement of Equity
Shareholder equity = preferred comon stock + paid in capital + retained earnings  
Retained earnings 
- Must have good trend of increasing (this is what increases networth), make sure it is not due to merger
- If it is decreasing, it would be ok if it is stock buyback 
- If companies that are pfoitable might not retain earnings cos they are very profitable

Treasury Shares
- It is good to see treasury shares, that means there is stock buyback action

Dividend
- History of dividend, does it pay during bad times, over a long period
	- Does it reduce div, increase etc
- Dividend yield change with stock price ($2 dividend is 20% for $10, and 10% for $20)
- Do not want dividend payout in a high growth company


### 4.4 Valuation
What is the P/E compared to industry and peers?
- If P/E between 8 - 12 times (any significant change can affect stock price)
- Do not want P/E that is too high
- Do not want low absolute earnings too
- P/E vs growth rate + dividend yield

Can try to get earnings of individual sub business and assign hypothetical PE to get their valuation
